Store your server's address in the environment variable `SERVER_IP_ADDRESS`.

Set up twitter API credentials [here](https://apps.twitter.com/). The callback URL should be your server's address appended with /oauth, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8080/oauth`.
Save your consumer key in the environment variable `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY` and your consumer secret in `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET`.
Generate your own access token and save it in the environment variable `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY` and save the access token secret in `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`.

Sign-in for the admin dash is done with any google hosted email address.
Set up google API credentials for the app as described [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/devconsole-project).
Save your client ID in the environment variable `TWEET_WALL_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and your client secret in `TWEET_WALL_OAUTH_SECRET`.
